*A centralized, community-driven scouting platform for FRC teams.*

VRoboHub is an in-development platform designed to unify scouting across FRC teams by providing a shared, validated, and easy-to-use data system. Built to encourage collaboration, fairness, and smarter strategy, VRoboHub aims to become an open resource for any team—regardless of size or resources.
